# Getting started with Python
  
  ##Features of Python 
    - Open source 
    - Object oriented language but can be used functionally and procedural styles as well
    - Dynamically typed 
    - Strongly typed
    - Whitespaces delimited - indentation / 4 spaces
    - Interpreted 
        - slower but helps the developer to interact directly 
      
  ## Different python editions
    - CPython
    - JPython
    - PyPy
    - IronPython
    
  PEPs, or Python Enhancement Proposals, can be submitted by anyone who has an idea about how to enhance the Python language. These are then reviewed, rejected, or accepted by the Python community, as a way to evolve the language.
   
   Python 2 vs Python 3 
    - Python 3 should be defualt 
    
  IDE 
    IDLE
      - Standard error - red 
      - Standard input - black 
      - Built-in - blue
      - Keyword - orange
    
   Whitespaces/ Indentation
   
         def myfunc:
             print('ML AI')

         if x>0:
             print('9')
         else:
             print('0')
             
           
   Input data
       > name = input('What is your name')
       
       print('Hello', name)
       It will have the space after hello by default 
       
    Modules 
    
      Any python file ending with .py/ .pyc/ .pyo can be used as a module
      
      how to add modules 
        import module
            import math as m 
            
        import functions
            from math import pi, tan
